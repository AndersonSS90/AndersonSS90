- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndersonSS90
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend and Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML and CSS. I know i am really late to the party.
But i really love development in general, and i am currently in the pursuit to reenter this beatiful world.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. If it needs collaboration, i am willing to participate.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I don't know how to answer this. I am really new to github, and don't really know how to use it (yet).
But i am working on it.
